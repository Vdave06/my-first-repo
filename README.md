## my-first-repo

A tiny starter repository to practice the command line, Git, and Python.

What you'll find here:

- A small Python script in `scripts/hello.py`.
- Minimal project metadata and a license.

## What I'm mastering

- Command line basics (pwd, ls, cd, mkdir)
- Git commands (git init, add, commit, push)
- Using VS Code like a pro!

## How to run

This project requires Python 3.6+. To run the included example script:

```bash
# from the repository root
python3 scripts/hello.py
```

Optional: create and activate a virtual environment before running:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux (zsh)
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if requirements.txt exists
```
